                                              ** Note * 
+  Efficient implementations using hardware like Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are also discussed in recent studies. These allow CNNs to handle large
computational loads effectively, facilitating high-speed, high-resolution iris image processing essential
for real-world applications (e.g., high-resolution CMOS sensors for focused image capture)...

3.Deep Learning-Based Iris Segmentation for Iris Recognition in Visible Light Environment
by Muhammad ArsalanORCID,Hyung Gil Hong,Rizwan Ali Naqvi,Min Beom Lee,Min Cheol Kim,Dong Seop Kim,Chan Sik Kim andKang Ryoung Park 
( https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/9/11/263 )
                                              ** Note * 
+  For environments with noise and varying light, two-stage iris segmentation methods based on CNNs have been successful in extracting iris features for classification. This approach focuses on boundary
identification and adaptation to intense settings with limited user cooperation, thus enhancing the robustness and reliability of iris authentication systems
