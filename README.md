# IrisSecurity
Explore the theoretical principles and novelties of iris biometrics for mobile financial security. 

# Iris authentication
one of the SPII (Sensitive Personal Identifiable Information) is one of the most powerful biometric technologies for security applications, such as physical access control... In fact, iris capture devices, based on visible light or near infrared technology, are characterized by non-invasiveness. Moreover, the iris of any subject is characterized by uniqueness, external visibility and remains the same throughout the subject's life - unless the eye has undergone cataract surgery, there will be a noticeable difference. Therefore, iris recognition systems are often preferred over systems based on other biometric technologies. 

# Here are some very important theoretical principles. 
First, in mobile financial security, the application of iris authentication will enhance security extremely high.
Two are the principles of iris authentication:
An authentication tool using the iris in the human eye, each person has only one and it is always different and cannot be faked or changed, except when the eye has undergone cataract surgery, it can be changed, but in short, it is still a very powerful and comprehensive authentication tool.
It comes with a high level of security, providing a degree of accuracy up to , compared to using a pin code or password. It can also be accompanied by fingerprint lock or facial authentication to enhance security.

# Using Kali to test the security of biometric systems (such as iris recognition).
Security Testing with Kali Linux within the conveniently available tools in Linux:
Nmap (for vulnerability scanning),
Burp Suite (for web application security testing).
Aircrack-ng: Provides guidance on Wi-Fi security testing in the case of mobile financial applications using public Wi-Fi.
